# EngiNeovim :nut_and_bolt::wrench::hammer:

## Introduction :memo:

**EngiNeovim** is *the* Neovim environment to use if your work is focused around mechanical engineering, engineering analysis, electrical engineering, or a related field. This environment excels in coding with Python, Matlab, Julia, Jupyter Notebooks, Lua -- heck, even VBA. But you don't just code! You also take extensive notes (Markdown, RST, AsciiDoc) and write detailed reports (LaTeX).

With [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), there's little effort required for you to get up and running with this Neovim configuration.

## Installation :inbox_tray:

This is a Neovim config like any other, so all you need to do is:

1. Make a backup of your current nvim config (optional but recommended): `mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bkp`
2. Clone this repo into the config folder: `git clone https://github.com/andysazima/EngiNeovim.git ~/.config/nvim`

## Getting Started :arrow_forward:

If you know Vim, great! You know how to use the greatest text editor ever invented. If you are new to Vim/Neovim, and assuming you have it installed, simply type `VimTutor` in your command line and press Enter. This will serve as a great introduction. If you are thinking of switching from another IDE/text editor (like PyCharm, VSCode, Spyder, etc.), I highly recommend sticking with what you know, but also installing the Vim plugin associated with your editor to start getting acquainted with Vim while staying in familiar territory. 

Once you have learned the basics, you can now start to use EngiNeovim like a pro! It uses [legendary.nvim](https://github.com/mrjones2014/legendary.nvim), which allows you to search for commands like you would in the VSCode command palette. You can easily learn the editor without needing to constantly refer to documentation or look at the source code.

## Things to Implement :construction_worker:

1. Common FEA solver syntax (Ansys, Abaqus, LS-Dyna, Radioss, etc.)
